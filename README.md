**About Me**

Iâ€™m a software engineer with over 15 years of experience. I hold an MSc in Astrophysics from UCL and have a lifelong passion for astronomy. 

Currently, I work at Lumi.Space, I build satellite tracking and space situational awareness tools.

Previously, I was on the Ground Segment team at Loft Orbital. I helped deliver their satellites-as-a-service platform. 

I work across frontend and backend stacksâ€”often using TypeScript, Go, Rust, Python or Vue. 

Outside work, I enjoy stargazing and exploring open-source projects in space tech.

**My Projects**

![observerly](https://github.com/michealroberts/michealroberts/blob/main/profile/github-readme-banner.png?raw=true)

I am the creator of [observerly](https://observerly.com), a next-generation platform for remote telescope control and astronomical observation.

- @observerly/astrometry: A fully lightweight, zero-dependency, type-safe library performing astrometric and astronomical calculations built for the web, written in TypeScript.
- SkySolve: A zero-dependency astrometric plate solving and image distortion analysis library for astronomical images, adhering to the WCS and SIP standards.
- IRIS ðŸ‘€ @observerly/iris: A zero-dependency framework for interoperating with images created by the ASCOM Alpaca API, written in Go.
- A fits, astroTIFF and XISF File Reader: I am developing .fits, astroTIFF and .xisf file reader and renderer, ported to the frontend using WebAssembly (WASM). More details to come soon!

Feel free to reach out if youâ€™re interested in astronomy, software development, or any of my projects!

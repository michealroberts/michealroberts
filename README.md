I'm a developer of some 10 years+ experience, specialising in both frontend and backend web technologies. In my day job, I am a software-engineer in the space industry for Loft Orbital. 

I specialise in frontend web technologies, mainly Typescript, XState, Next.js, Nuxt.js and tRPC.io, but I also have deep knowledge of both Python 3+ (FastAPI, Django) and Go lang (Gin Gonic, Fiber).

I am also an early-adopter of Vue (from v1), and an ealy-adopter of TailwindCSS (again, from v1). 

I'm a major astronomy ðŸ”­ enthusiast, and I'm currently building [observerly](https://observerly.com) - a next-generation remote telescope and astronomical observation platform.

I'm currently building a Go based .FITS and .XSIF file reader and rendering, which I will port to the frontend using WASM.

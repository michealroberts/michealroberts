**About Me**

I am an astronomy enthusiast with an MSc in Astrophysics from University College London (UCL). 

Currently, I work as a software engineer in the space industry at Lumi.Space, where I contribute to cutting-edge satellite tracking and space-situational awareness technology.

With over a decade of experience in software development, I specialize in both frontend and backend technologies. I am particularly passionate about TypeScript, Go, Rust and Vue.

**My Projects**

![observerly](https://github.com/michealroberts/michealroberts/blob/main/profile/github-readme-banner.png?raw=true)

I am the creator of [observerly](https://observerly.com), a next-generation platform for remote telescope control and astronomical observation.

- @observerly/astrometry: A fully lightweight, zero-dependency, type-safe library performing astrometric and astronomical calculations built for the web, written in TypeScript.
- SkySolve: A zero-dependency astrometric plate solving and image distortion analysis library for astronomical images, adhering to the WCS and SIP standards.
- IRIS ðŸ‘€ @observerly/iris: A zero-dependency framework for interoperating with images created by the ASCOM Alpaca API, written in Go.
- A fits, astroTIFF and XISF File Reader: I am developing .fits, astroTIFF and .xisf file reader and renderer, ported to the frontend using WebAssembly (WASM). More details to come soon!

Feel free to reach out if youâ€™re interested in astronomy, software development, or any of my projects!

I'm an astronomy ðŸ”­ enthusiast, completing my MSc in Astrophysics at University College London (UCL).

In my day job, I am a software-engineer in the space industry for Loft Orbital. We're currently working on delivering a constellation of satellites to orbit.

I'm a developer of some 10 years+ experience, specialising in both frontend and backend technologies. I'm a big fan of TypeScript, Go, and Vue.

I'm currently building [observerly](https://observerly.com) - a next-generation remote telescope and astronomical observation platform.

I'm currently building a fully tree-shakeable, zero-dependency TypeScript library for performing astrometric and astronomical calculations [@observerly/astrometry](https://github.com/observerly/astrometry).

I'm currently building a Go based framework for interoperating with images created by the ASCOM Alpaca API, called IRIS ðŸ‘€ [@observerly/iris](https://github.com/observerly/iris).

I'm also currently building a Go based .FITS and .XSIF file reader and rendering, ported to the frontend using WASM. More details to come soon!

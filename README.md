**About Me**

Iâ€™m a software engineer with over 15 years of experience. I hold an MSc in Astrophysics from UCL and have a lifelong passion for astronomy. 

Currently, I work at lumi.space, where I build satellite tracking and space situational awareness tools.

Previously, I was on the Ground Segment team at Loft Orbital. I helped deliver their satellites-as-a-service platform.

I work across frontend and backend stacks where I am comfortable with TypeScript, Go, Rust, Python and Vue.

Outside work, I enjoy stargazing and exploring open-source projects.
